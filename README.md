# Hadoop Ecosystem Repository Connectors

This repository houses the ODPi Egeria connectors for various Hadoop ecosystem components:

- [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org) is an open source metadata repository. This connector provides an example
    implementation for interacting with a metadata repository through the open metadata standards of Egeria.

    Note that currently the implemented connector is read-only: it only implements those methods necessary to search, retrieve,
    and communicate metadata from Atlas out into the cohort -- it does *not* currently implement the ability to update Atlas
    based on events received from other members of the cohort. (This is due to some current limitations in Apache Atlas -- 
    see [open issues](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-apache-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aexternal).)

    Furthermore, [only a subset of the overall Open Metadata Types are currently implemented](docs/mappings/README.md).

- [Apache Ranger](https://ranger.apache.org) is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data security
    across the Hadoop platform.  (Coming soon.)

## How it works

The Apache Atlas Repository Connector works through a combination of the following:

- Apache Atlas's REST API, itself abstracted through the Apache Atlas Java Client
- Apache Atlas's embedded Apache Kafka event bus
    - specifically the `ATLAS_ENTITIES` topic

## Getting started

### TL;DR

The quick version:

1. Download the latest Apache Atlas connector from: https://odpi.jfrog.io/odpi/egeria-snapshot-local/org/odpi/egeria/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package/2.3-SNAPSHOT/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package-2.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
1. Download the latest Egeria core from: https://odpi.jfrog.io/odpi/egeria-snapshot-local/org/odpi/egeria/server-chassis-spring/2.3-SNAPSHOT/server-chassis-spring-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
1. Rename the downloaded Egeria core file to `egeria-server-chassis-spring.jar`.
1. Run the following command to start Egeria from the command-line, waiting for the final line of output indicating the
    server is running and ready for configuration:
    ```bash
    $ export STRICT_SSL=false
    $ java -Dloader.path=. -jar egeria-server-chassis-spring.jar
     ODPi Egeria

    ```
1. In another shell / command-line window, run the following commands to configure Egeria and startup its services --
    making sure to replace the hostnames and port numbers with those relevant to your own environment (`localhost:9092`
    for your own Kafka bus, `atlas:9027` with the Atlas-embedded Kafka host and port, `atlas` with
    the hostname of your Apache Atlas server, `21000` with the port number of your Apache Atlas server,
    `admin` with the username for your Apache Atlas environment, and `admin` with the password for your Apache Atlas
    environment):
    ```bash
    $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"producer":{"bootstrap.servers":"localhost:9092"},"consumer":{"bootstrap.servers":"localhost:9092"}}' "https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/event-bus?connectorProvider=org.odpi.openmetadata.adapters.eventbus.topic.kafka.KafkaOpenMetadataTopicProvider&topicURLRoot=OMRSTopic"
    $ curl -X POST "https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/cohorts/mycohort"
    $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"class":"Connection","connectorType":{"class":"ConnectorType","connectorProviderClassName":"org.odpi.egeria.connectors.apache.atlas.repositoryconnector.ApacheAtlasOMRSRepositoryConnectorProvider"},"endpoint":{"class":"Endpoint","address":"atlas:21000","protocol":"http"},"userId":"admin","clearPassword":"admin"}' "https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/local-repository/mode/repository-proxy/connection"
    $ curl -X POST "https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/local-repository/event-mapper-details?connectorProvider=org.odpi.egeria.connectors.apache.atlas.eventmapper.ApacheAtlasOMRSRepositoryEventMapperProvider&eventSource=atlas:9027"
    $ curl -X POST "https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/instance"
    ```

### Enable Apache Atlas's events

To start using the connector, you will need an Apache Atlas environment, ideally running version 2. You will need to
first enable all event notifications (ie. including for relationships) in your Apache Atlas environment, by adding the
following line to your `conf/atlas-application.properties` file:

```properties
atlas.notification.relationships.enabled=true
```

You will likely need to restart your environment after making this change.

### Obtain the connector

You can either download the latest released or snapshot version of the connector directly from ODPi, or build the
connector yourself. In both cases, once you have the jar file for the connector
(`egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`) this needs to be copied to a
location where it can be run alongside the OMAG Server Platform from Egeria core itself. For example, this could be
placing the file into the `/lib` directory as `/lib/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

#### Download from ODPi

To download a pre-built version of the connector, use either of the following URLs (depending on whether you want an
officially-released version or the latest snapshot):

- Release: https://odpi.jfrog.io/odpi/egeria-release-local/org/odpi/egeria/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package/2.2/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package-2.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar
- Snapshot: https://odpi.jfrog.io/odpi/egeria-snapshot-local/org/odpi/egeria/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package/2.3-SNAPSHOT/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package-2.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

#### Building the connector yourself

Alternatively, you can build the connector yourself. To do this, you'll need to first clone this repository and then
build through Maven using `mvn clean install`. After building, the connector is available as:

```text
distribution/target/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

### Configure security

There are [multiple options to configure the security of your environment](docs/security/README.md) for this connector,
but this must be done prior to starting up the connector itself (step below).

For simple tests, if you can run your Apache Atlas environment with only its most basic security and without HTTPS, then
there is nothing additional you need to configure for the connector.

Alternatively, if you can still use basic authentication (username and password) but must run Apache Atlas via HTTPS,
and you simply want to test things out, the simplest (but most insecure) option is to set the environment variable
`STRICT_SSL` to `false` using something like the following prior to starting up the OMAG Server Platform:

```bash
export STRICT_SSL=false
```

Note that this will disable all certificate validation for SSL connections made between Egeria and your Apache Atlas
environment, so is inherently insecure.

### Startup the OMAG Server Platform

You can startup the OMAG Server Platform with this connector ready-to-be-configured by running:

```bash
$ java -Dloader.path=/lib -jar server-chassis-spring-VERSION.jar
```

(This command will startup the OMAG Server Platform, including all libraries
in the `/lib` directory as part of the classpath of the OMAG Server Platform.)

### Configure this Egeria connector

You will need to configure the OMAG Server Platform as follows (order is important) to make use of this Egeria connector.
For example payloads and endpoints, see the [Postman samples](samples).

1. Configure your event bus for Egeria, by POSTing a payload like the following:

    ```json
    {
        "producer": {
            "bootstrap.servers":"localhost:9092"
        },
        "consumer": {
            "bootstrap.servers":"localhost:9092"
        }
    }
    ```

    to:

    ```
    POST https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/event-bus?connectorProvider=org.odpi.openmetadata.adapters.eventbus.topic.kafka.KafkaOpenMetadataTopicProvider&topicURLRoot=OMRSTopic
    ```

1. Configure the cohort, by POSTing something like the following:

    ```
    POST https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/cohorts/mycohort
    ```

1. Configure the Apache Atlas connector, by POSTing a payload like the following, replacing the `{{atlas_host}}` with
    the hostname of your Apache Atlas instance, `{{atlas_port}}` with the port number of it, `{{atlas_user}}` with the
    username of a user able to access the REST API (eg. `admin`), and `{{atlas_password}}` with the password for that
    user:

    ```json
    {
        "class": "Connection",
        "connectorType": {
            "class": "ConnectorType",
            "connectorProviderClassName": "org.odpi.egeria.connectors.apache.atlas.repositoryconnector.ApacheAtlasOMRSRepositoryConnectorProvider"
        },
        "endpoint": {
            "class": "Endpoint",
            "address": "{{atlas_host}}:{{atlas_port}}",
            "protocol": "http"
        },
        "userId": "{{atlas_user}}",
        "clearPassword": "{{atlas_password}}"
    }
    ```

    to:

    ```
    POST https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/local-repository/mode/repository-proxy/connection
    ```

    Note that you also need to provide the `connectorProviderClassName` parameter, set to the name of the Apache Atlas
    connectorProvider class (value as given above).

1. Configure the event mapper for Apache Atlas, by POSTing something like the following:

    ```
    POST https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/local-repository/event-mapper-details?connectorProvider=org.odpi.egeria.connectors.apache.atlas.eventmapper.ApacheAtlasOMRSRepositoryEventMapperProvider&eventSource=my.atlas.host.com:9027
    ```

    The hostname provided at the end should be the host on which your Apache Atlas Kafka bus is running, and include
    the appropriate port number for connecting to that bus. (By default, for the embedded Kafka bus, the port is `9027`.)

1. The connector and event mapper should now be configured, and you should now be able
    to start the instance by POSTing something like the following:

   ```
   POST https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/myserver/instance
   ```

After following these instructions, your Apache Atlas instance will be participating in the Egeria cohort. For those
objects supported by the connector, most new instances or updates to existing instances should result in that metadata
automatically being communicated out to the rest of the cohort.

(Note: there are still some limitations with Apache Atlas that prevent this being true for _all_ types, eg. see 
[Jira ATLAS-3312](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ATLAS/issues/ATLAS-3312))

## Loading samples

If you have a completely empty Apache Atlas environment, you may want to load some sample metadata to further explore.

Samples are provided under [samples](samples):

- `AtlasGlossary.zip` contains a sample glossary, set of categories and terms as defined in the [Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-deployment/sample-data/coco-pharmaceuticals)
    set of samples.

These can be loaded to the environment using the following command:

```shell script
$ curl -g -X POST -u <user>:<password> -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -F data=@AtlasGlossary.zip "http://<host>:<port>/api/atlas/admin/import"
```

For additional samples, eg. of Hadoop-native entity types, see the [Hortonworks Sanbox](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox.html).
