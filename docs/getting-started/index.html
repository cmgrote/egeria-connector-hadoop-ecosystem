                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Just use the <a href="#" class="navigate-right">right arrow</a> on your keyboard: each slide is one step, with minimal explanation.

                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    If at any point you want more of an explanation, use the <a href="#" class="navigate-down">down arrow</a>
                    on your keyboard to drill-down.

                    Aha, you want more!
                    <br><br>
                    This getting started guide is written using a great web-based presentation framework
                    called <a href="https://revealjs.com" target="reveal">reveal.js</a>. You can use its icons
                    on the slides to move around, or you can use keyboard shortcuts. Try the <code>?</code> key
                    to bring up a cheatsheet of the keyboard shortcuts.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    At any point, you can also press the <code>m</code> key to bring up the menu. From the menu you
                    can quickly jump to any particular topic.
                </p>

                    Looking for more about how the connectors actually work, rather than this primer on keyboard
                    shortcuts? Proceed downwards once again.

                <img src="img/overview1.png">
                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    The Apache Atlas connector is implemented as a repository proxy that
                    runs through the Egeria OMAG Platform (server chassis). It does so by being implemented as
                    an Open Metadata Repository Connector and implementing the repository-level methods defined
                    by the Metadata Collection interface.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section data-transition="fade">
                <h4 style="text-align: left;">How it works</h4>
                <img src="img/overview2.png">
                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    The connector communicates with an existing Apache Atlas environment through its
                    Java client. Note that the connector <em>only</em> supports reading metadata from Apache
                    Atlas and is unable to create or update any metadata. Write operations can only be done
                    by a user through Apache Atlas's supported web UIs or APIs, or through some other pre-built
                    integration with Apache Atlas (e.g. for Hive, etc).
                </p>

                <h4 style="text-align: left;">How it works</h4>
                <img src="../overview.png">
                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    The connector also implements an event mapper: this uses Apache Atlas's embedded Kafka
                    notifications capability to automatically push metadata changes out to a broader cohort.
                    Note that only metadata that produces such notifications within Apache Atlas can trigger
                    this capability (this does not include, for example, glossary metadata like terms and categories).

                    Our development snapshots are hosted directly within Nexus's open source snapshot repository.
                    You can download them there using Maven itself, or by
                    <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/odpi/egeria/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem-package/" target="dev">navigating to the site</a>
                    and looking for the latest version of the <code>jar-with-dependencies.jar</code> file.

                    To build the server chassis, you will need to have at least Java version 1.8 installed as well
                    as Apache Maven (at least version 3.6). Clone <a href="https://github.com/odpi/egeria" target="ec">Egeria's GitHub repository</a> and then

                    The <a href="https://github.com/odpi/egeria/raw/master/truststore.p12">truststore.p12</a>
                    file provides a local truststore for Java. This allows the self-signed certificate embedded
                    within the server chassis (by default) to be trusted.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Without this trust, interactions with the server chassis (such as the REST calls that are made
                    through Java to handle interaction between the chassis and the connector) will result in an
                    <code>SSLHandshakeException</code>.

                <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    While this <code>truststore.p12</code> file allows SSL-encrypted communication, the fact that
                    it relies on a self-signed certificate means that there is no independent source of trust
                    in the interactions (which would typically be achieved through an independent Certificate
                    Authority).

                <p class="fragment" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Additional details on TLS for Egeria can be found in <a href="https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/user/omag-server-platform-transport-level-security.html">the Egeria documentation</a>.

                    While the <code>truststore.p12</code> file sets up TLS for Egeria itself, there is also the
                    communication between the connector and the Apache Atlas environment to consider.

                    The simplest method to configure this layer of the transport is to disable SSL verification
                    itself, which you can do by exporting the environment variable <code>STRICT_SSL=false</code>
                    or passing the argument <code>-Dstrict.ssl=false</code> to the java command when running the
                    server chassis.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Both of these effectively disable security, however, so for a more robust (albeit also more
                    cumbersome) approach see the further details on other options in the pages below.

                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    With this approach you can tell Java to trust the certificate of one or more systems, even when those systems only
                    have self-signed certificates. This is more secure than entirely disabling SSL verification, as it provides a sort
                    of whitelist for certificates to trust; however, it does not rely on an independent party to verify that trust.
                    Done without proper diligence, there is therefore still some risk in this approach.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Begin by obtaining the self-signed certificate of the Atlas host (from any machine with a JVM: could be the Egeria
                    OMAG Server Platform so long as you're confident it is reaching the correct host):

$ keytool -printcert -sslserver my.atlas.host.com:21000 -rfc > atlas_self_signed.crt
						</code></pre>
                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Note that you need to use the correct hostname and port number of your Apache Atlas environment.
                    ("Correct hostname" means the hostname by which that server knows itself -- it should <em>not</em> be an IP address.)

            <section data-transition="fade-in slide-out">

                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    Next, import the certificate into the Java keystore used by the environment. For example, in an Alpine openjdk docker
                    image, this would be <code>/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts</code>:
                </p>

                <ul style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    <li>The keystore location should be specified, and it is best to use the one for the environment itself (if a
                        user-specific keystore it will likely depend on the user under which the JVM itself is running whether it is
                        picked up or not).</li>
                    <li>The default keystore password in Java is <code>changeit</code>; obviously replace this with the password for your actual
                        keystore if it has been changed... (Both the <code>-storepass</code> and <code>-noprompt</code> can be skipped if you would rather be
                        prompted for the password and confirmation of importing the certificate.)</li>
                    <li>The <code>-alias</code> should be specified and <b>must</b> match the hostname of the Atlas machine itself:
                        if different, the certificate won't match and won't be validated.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    This approach is generally accepted as the most robust and secure. It relies on a third party (a
                    "certificate authority") to sign the certificates to be used by your environments, and leverages
                    inherent trust in these third parties in order to validate such signed certificates automatically.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    However, this option also relies on obtaining (typically at a cost) such certificate signatures, and
                    updating the configuration of your system(s) to leverage these new signed certificates rather than the
                    self-signed certificates they possess by default.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    More information on doing this specifically for Apache Atlas can be found
                    in <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.0.0/configuring-wire-encryption/content/enable_ssl_for_apache_atlas.html" target="cloudera">Cloudera's documentation</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment" style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">
                    After configuring such a signed certificate, you should be able to connect to the Atlas environment
                    without any further configuration of either the connector, OMAG Server Platform, or Java keystores.

                    You should now be able to start accessing metadata in Apache Atlas via Egeria.
                    Without any additional dependencies, this is most easily illustrated using direct REST API
                    interactions with the server chassis's repository services. We suggest the following steps:
